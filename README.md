### Hi there 👋
My name is David 😃 and I'm a Software Engineer with a background in Biology 🧬 and Physical Therapy 🏃‍. I worked full-time for three years at Robert Wood Johnson Hospital 🏥 in New Brunswick, NJ as a Physical Therapy aide on a great team, helping various patients each day, so customer service and teamwork are really important to me, and are two skills that I am very proud of. After learning about cutting edge research that would blend virtual reality 🤖 with stroke rehabilitation 👨‍🦯, I fell in love with learning about technology that improves quality of life for others. So, I decided to switch careers in the summer of 2020, and found an amazing program at App Academy.

The 1000+ hour rigorous program taught me technologies such as Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Not only did I develop a strong passion for software development, but also found an amazing community of fellow software developers that I know I can count on for years to come. When I'm not programming 💻, I love to hike 🥾, run 🏃, train in judo 🤼, and eat Korean BBQ 🍖 and sushi 🍣.
